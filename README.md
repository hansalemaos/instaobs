## With InstaOBS you can stream directly from OBS to Instagram 

I used [BurbnBot's](https://github.com/harrypython/BurbnBot) https://github.com/harrypython/itsagramlive
and added a small GUI to it. Then I compiled it to an [EXE](https://github.com/hansalemaos/instaobs/blob/main/instaobs.exe) file, so that every noob (without programming knowledge) can use it! Just download the [EXE](https://github.com/hansalemaos/instaobs/blob/main/instaobs.exe) file and start it! Stay away from sketchy websites where you have to provide your login information! I once screwed my Instagram Account because of that! This app only connects to Instagram from YOUR IP (see source code!) After connecting to Instagram, it shows you the rtmp server's address and the streaming key (also copied to clipboard). With this information, you can stream directly from OBS (or any other app) to Instagram.
Please support [BurbnBot's](https://github.com/harrypython/BurbnBot) work with a little donation! I only spent an hour on it, he certainly had more work than me.
