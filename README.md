## With InstaOBS you can stream directly from OBS to Instagram 

I used [BurbnBot's](https://github.com/harrypython/BurbnBot) https://github.com/harrypython/itsagramlive
and added a small GUI to it. Then I compiled it to an [EXE](https://github.com/hansalemaos/instaobs/blob/main/instaobs.exe) file, so every noob (without programming knowledge) can use it! Just download the [EXE](https://github.com/hansalemaos/instaobs/blob/main/instaobs.exe) file and start it! Stay away from sketchy websites where you have to give them your login information! I once screwed my Instagram Account because of that! This app only connects to Instagram (see source code!)
Please support [BurbnBot's](https://github.com/harrypython/BurbnBot) work!
