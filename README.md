With InstaOBS you can stream directly from OBS to Instagram 

I used [BurbnBot's](https://github.com/harrypython/BurbnBot) https://github.com/harrypython/itsagramlive
and added a small GUI to it. Then I compiled it to an EXE file, so every noob (without programming knowledge) can use it! Just download the EXE file and start it! Stay away from sketchy websites where you have to give them your login information! I once screwed my Instagram Account because of that! This app only connects to Instagram (see source code!)
Please support [BurbnBot's](https://github.com/harrypython/BurbnBot) work!
